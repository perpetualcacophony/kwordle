# kwordle
A generalized wordle library for Rust.

This doesn't really need to exist, but I noticed that there's seemingly no library for building your own Wordle game. I happened to be in the mood to move the wordle code from [an existing project](https://github.com/perpetualcacophony/slimebot) to its own crate, and I felt like developing for the sake of developing.

Documentation for the `master` branch is at [perpetualcacophony.github.io/kwordle/docs/](https://perpetualcacophony.github.io/kwordle/docs).
